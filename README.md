## üöÄ Getting Started: Complete Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher.
- **MongoDB**: A local installation or a free MongoDB Atlas account.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Code Editor**: VS Code is recommended.

### 2. Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd medium-clone-mern
````

Then, run the setup script from the root directory. This will install dependencies for the root, backend, and frontend concurrently.

```bash
npm run setup
```

### 3\. Database Setup

You can use either a local MongoDB instance or a cloud-hosted one with MongoDB Atlas.

  - **Option A: Local MongoDB**

      - Install MongoDB Community Edition for your operating system.
      - Start the MongoDB service. On macOS, this is typically `brew services start mongodb-community`.

  - **Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)**

    1.  Create a free account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
    2.  Create a new cluster.
    3.  Get your connection string and whitelist your current IP address.

### 4\. Environment Configuration

The project uses `.env` files for managing environment variables.

  - **Backend (`backend/.env`)**

    1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
    2.  Copy the example file: `cp .env.example .env`
    3.  Edit the new `.env` file with your specific configuration:
        ```env
        PORT=5000
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/medium-clone
        # OR for Atlas: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/medium-clone
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_make_it_very_long_and_random
        NODE_ENV=development

        # Add Cloudinary credentials below (see next section)
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
        ```

  - **Frontend (`frontend/.env`)**

      - The frontend is pre-configured to connect to the backend at `http://localhost:5000/api`. No changes are needed for local development.

### 5\. Cloudinary Setup (For Image Uploads)

For handling image uploads, the application uses Cloudinary, which provides generous free-tier limits, optimization, and a CDN.

  - **Local Fallback**: If Cloudinary is not configured, the app will fall back to storing images locally in the `backend/uploads` folder. However, **Cloudinary is strongly recommended for all environments, including development.**

  - **Setup Steps**:

    1.  Create a free account at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com).
    2.  From your account dashboard, find and copy your **Cloud Name**, **API Key**, and **API Secret**.
    3.  Paste these credentials into your `backend/.env` file:
        ```env
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
        ```

  - **Free Tier**: The free tier includes 25 GB of storage, 25 GB of monthly bandwidth, and 1,000 transformations per month, which is ample for most small-to-medium applications.

### 6\. Start the Application

Return to the root directory and run the development script:

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```

This command concurrently starts both the backend and frontend servers:

  - **Backend API**: `http://localhost:5000`
  - **Frontend App**: `http://localhost:3000`

## üöÄ Deployment

### Backend (Node.js)

  - **Hosting**: Deploy to services like Heroku, Railway, or a DigitalOcean Droplet.
  - **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas in production for reliability and scalability.
  - **Environment**: Ensure all `.env` variables (especially `NODE_ENV=production`, `JWT_SECRET`, and Cloudinary keys) are set in your hosting provider's dashboard.
  - **Process Management**: Use a process manager like PM2 to keep the application running.

### Frontend (React)

  - **Hosting**: Deploy to a static hosting provider like Vercel or Netlify for the best performance.
  - **Build**: Run `npm run build` to create a production-optimized build of the frontend.
  - **Environment**: Update the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in your hosting provider's settings to point to your live backend URL.

-----

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

  - **Server won't start**:
      - Ensure your MongoDB service is running or that your Atlas IP is whitelisted.
      - Verify that the `backend/.env` file exists and that all variables, especially `MONGODB_URI`, are correct.
      - Check if port 5000 is being used by another application.
  - **Image upload fails**:
      - Double-check your Cloudinary credentials in `backend/.env`.
      - Ensure the `backend/uploads` folder exists if using the local fallback.
      - Check file size (under 5MB) and format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP).

### Frontend Issues

  - **Can't connect to backend**:
      - Make sure the backend server is running on port 5000.
      - Check the browser's developer console for network or CORS errors.

### General Solution

If you encounter persistent issues, try a clean reinstall:

```bash
# 1. Stop all running servers (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Remove all node_modules folders and lock files
rm -rf node_modules backend/node_modules frontend/node_modules
rm -rf package-lock.json backend/package-lock.json frontend/package-lock.json

# 3. Reinstall all dependencies
npm run setup

# 4. Restart the development server
npm run dev
```

-----

## üîê Security Notes

  - **JWT Secret**: Always change the `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` to a long, complex, and random string.
  - **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control. Use them for all sensitive data.
  - **Production Database**: Enable authentication and strong access controls on your production MongoDB instance.
  - **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
  - **CORS**: For production, configure CORS in the backend to only allow requests from your frontend's domain.
